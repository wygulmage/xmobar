## Version 0.12 (Dec 24, 2010)

xmobar has a new [maintainer], a new [website], a new [mailing
list] and uses a new [source code repository].

Many thanks to Andrea Rossato, xombar's author and maintainer so far,
for creating xmobar in the first place, and for giving me the chance
to become its maintainer. And a big thanks to Ben Boeckel, Petr Rockai
and Norbert Zeh for their patches.

_New features_

  - Window borders: configuration options `border` and `borderColor`
    allow drawing borders around xmobar's window.
  - New monitor, `Uptime`, showing the system uptime.
  - New monitor argument (`-S`) to enable displaying the `%` symbol in
    percentages or other suffixes (e.g., units in Uptime and Network);
    the symbol is now never included by default.
  - New 'run once' commands, by specifying a 0 refresh rate in `Run
    Com` ([issue 26]).
  - MPD monitor: updated to libmpd 1.5. New fields `ppos` (playlist
    position) and `remaining` (remaining time). New configuration
    options to specify MPD's host, user name and password.
  - Battery monitor: new `watts` and `timeleft` fields (Petr Rockai),
    and specific arguments to control coloring and thresholds of the
    former.
  - MultiCPU monitor: new `auto*` fields that automatically detect all
    present CPUs (Ben Boeckel).
  - CpuFreq monitor uses just one decimal digit for GHz values (Petr
    Rockai).
  - Mail plugin expands paths starting with "~/" (Ben Boeckel). Ditto
    MBox.
  - Weather monitor now skips not retrieved fields, instead of
    displaying a long error message.
  - New compilation flag, `all_extensions`.
  - Documentation and website updates.

_Bug fixes_

  - [issue 23]: Wireless monitor is now compatible with iwlib 29.
  - [issue 24]: Swap monitor's used ratio display fixed.
  - [issue 25]: Percentages only include `%` if requested using `-P`.

  - Fixes in CPU frequency formatting, string alignment and colour
    boxes in monitors (Norbert Zeh).
  - TopMem and TopProc now use the `-L` and `-H` options correctly for
    memory template fields.
  - MBox skips non-existent mbox paths instead of hanging.
